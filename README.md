# Mosque-of-Damascus

This is a pilot/pet project so that I can experiment with my limited knowledge of HTML and CSS. I would very much like to add some Javascript functionality in here as well.

It also gives me a chance to compile all the multimedia information I've gathered about the mosque, so that other people can appreciate how amazing it is.

Feel free to explore and learn!
